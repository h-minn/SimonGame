# Simon Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game. The game challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds, testing their memory and focus. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in **The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

### Introduction
Simon Game is a memory game where players must remember and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colored buttons. The game continues until the player fails to repeat the sequence correctly.

### How to Play
1. When you start the game, a random sequence of colors will be shown.
2. Your task is to repeat the sequence in the same order by clicking the corresponding color buttons.
3. If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will generate a new color to add to the sequence.
4. The game continues until you make a mistake, at which point you will be presented with a "Game Over" message.
5. You can restart the game after a game over.
